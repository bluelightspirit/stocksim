To setup, use [Visual Studio 2017](https://aka.ms/vs/15/release/vs_community.exe) as that is what was used to code this project. Windows 10 and 11 were tested for this.

Then at the bottom right, press "Modify" if you already have Visual Studio installed, or "Install" if you do not. The image below shows Modify at the bottom right as bluelightspirit who wrote this has Visual Studio 2017 installed already.

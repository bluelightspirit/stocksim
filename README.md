# Stock Market Simulation System
## Expected Setup
To setup, use [Visual Studio 2017](https://aka.ms/vs/15/release/vs_community.exe) as that is what was used to code this project. Windows 10 and 11 were tested for this. Be sure "Desktop development with C++", "Git for windows" and "GitHub extension for Visual Studio" is check marked and downloaded inside Visual Studio 2017, like the image below:

Then at the bottom right, press "Modify" if you already have Visual Studio installed, or "Install" if you do not. The image below shows Modify at the bottom right as bluelightspirit who wrote this has Visual Studio 2017 installed already.

After that, at the top left, press "File" then "Start Page"

Then, at the top left again, press "File", hover over "Open", then press "Open from GitHub..."

Press "URL", select a directory and take note of that directory, then click the popup text box and in it, type in or paste "https://github.com/bluelightspirit/stocksim" then after it is typed in, Press "Clone" at the bottom like this:

## NEW STEPS

Navigate to the directory you cloned with the note you have. Open that folder, which should have ConsoleApplication1.sln in it. Once you are in the folder that has this file, open the x64 folder. Then, open the Release folder. Finally, run ConsoleApplication1.exe - this will work versus running it in Visual Studio consistently in my tests.

## Usage
To use the stock market simulator, type in a name, then it gives you commands to use and has decent guidance to help you out. Just follow exactly what the instructions say and do not enter in non-integers when a whole number is requested.

## Compiling
This program uses solely C++ to compile.
